## **Prompt 1: Extract Casing Information**

**Role:**  
You are an oilfield cementing expert reviewing the stick diagram and drilling program for the well "CNRL HZ ELM 9-33-66-5" (Montney HZ).

**Task:**  
Extract and tabulate the following casing details for each string:

*   Casing size (mm/inches), weight (kg/m or lb/ft), grade, thread type
*   Wiper plug type and supplier
*   Centralizer supplier, type(s), spacing
*   Completion system used
*   Float equipment details (shoe, collar, sub, etc.)
*   Special notes on running casing (e.g., surge limits, installation rates)

**Instructions:**  
Format the output as a table with one row per casing string. If any data is missing, mark as 'Not specified'.

## **Prompt 2: Extract Cement Details**

**Role:**  
You are an oilfield cementing expert analyzing the cementing program for the same well.

**Task:**  
Extract and tabulate the following cementing details for each interval:

*   Preflush type and volume
*   Cement blend name, density (kg/m³), and interval placed
*   Cement excess requested (% or volume)
*   Expected temperatures (BHST or other relevant values)
*   Working time and special instructions (e.g., thixotropic cement handling)
*   Supplier information

**Instructions:**  
Format the output as a table with one row per cementing interval. If any data is missing, mark as 'Not specified'.

## **Prompt 3: Operational Recommendations**

**Role:**  
You are an oilfield cementing expert providing operational recommendations based on the extracted casing and cementing details.

**Task:**  
Interpret the extracted data and provide recommendations, including:

*   Risks or special requirements (e.g., loss zones, sour service, dual barrier requirements)
*   Instructions for well control, barrier installation, notifications
*   Summary of completion system and liner equipment
*   Contingent or alternate plans (e.g., WR Bridge Plug if pressure test fails)

**Instructions:**  
Format output as bullet points grouped by operational phase (surface, intermediate, production).

## **Pro Tip for ChatGPT Use**

*   Paste each prompt separately for focused, structured responses.
*   Request tables and bullet points for clarity.
*   For multi-step reasoning, ask ChatGPT to explain its logic before final output.

***

**What Changed:**

*   Prompts are now tailored for ChatGPT’s conversational structure.
*   Output formats (tables, bullet points) specified for clarity.
*   Context and role assignment ensure expert-level interpretation.

Would you like a **sample output** using your actual stick diagram data, or do you want to use these prompts directly in ChatGPT?
