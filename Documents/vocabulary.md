<!-- Identifier: I-04 -->
**UWI**: Unique Well Identifier, it defines bottom-hole location

**GL**: Ground Level

**KB**: Kelly Bushing(a component on the drilling rig floor used as a reference point for depth measurements).

**GL to KB**: It indicates the **vertical distance between the ground level and the kelly bushing**. This offset is important because most well depth measurements (e.g., Measured Depth (MD) or True Vertical Depth (TVD)) are referenced to the KB rather than the ground level.

**MD**: Measure Depth

**TVD**: True Vertical Depth

**SS Depth**: Sub-Sea Depth
