# Root Vocabulary

This document maps canonical names and their variants identified during the enterprise-level analysis. It serves as the authoritative source for organizational terminology standardization.

## Purpose

The vocabulary ensures consistent terminology across all organizational documentation, systems, and communications. It helps eliminate ambiguity and promotes clear understanding among all stakeholders.

## Usage Guidelines

### Consistency Rules
1. **Always use canonical names** in official documentation and system interfaces
2. **Document variants** when encountered in legacy systems or external communications
3. **Update legacy documentation** to use canonical terms during revision cycles
4. **Train personnel** on canonical terminology to ensure consistent usage

### Communication Standards
- Use canonical names in all formal communications
- Explain canonical terms when communicating with external parties who may use variants
- Maintain a glossary reference for complex or technical terms
- Ensure system interfaces use canonical naming conventions

### Documentation Standards
- Begin documents with vocabulary references when introducing new terms
- Link to this vocabulary document for authoritative definitions
- Update this vocabulary when new terms are identified during analysis
- Review and validate terminology consistency during document reviews

## Term Evolution

### Adding New Terms
1. Identify the canonical form based on organizational standards
2. Document all known variants encountered during analysis
3. Define the term clearly with contextual information
4. Update this document and notify stakeholders of new terminology

### Updating Existing Terms
1. Propose changes through organizational review process
2. Assess impact on existing documentation and systems
3. Create migration plan for terminology updates
4. Communicate changes to all affected stakeholders

## Notes

This vocabulary will be extended and refined as detailed analysis progresses through sub-processes. Each process-level vocabulary document should reference and extend this root vocabulary while maintaining consistency with the canonical terms defined here.

Sub-process vocabularies should focus on terms specific to their domain while maintaining alignment with these enterprise-level canonical terms.
