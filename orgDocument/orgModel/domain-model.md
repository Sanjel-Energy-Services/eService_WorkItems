# Root Domain Model

This document identifies the core actors, systems, entities, and their relationships within the scope of the enterprise-level organizational processes.

## Domain Overview

The organizational domain encompasses the key entities involved in service delivery, operations management, and strategic oversight. This model provides the foundation for understanding how different components of the organization interact and relate to each other.

## Core Entities

  - Role: [To be defined based on analysis]
  - Relationships: [To be defined based on analysis]

- **[External Actor 2]**
  - Attributes: [To be defined based on analysis]
  - Role: [To be defined based on analysis]
  - Relationships: [To be defined based on analysis]

#### Internal Actors
- **[Internal Actor 1]**
  - Attributes: [To be defined based on analysis]

### Systems

- **[System 1]**
  - Attributes: [To be defined based on analysis]

## Notes

This domain model represents the enterprise-level view. Each sub-process will have more detailed domain models focusing on specific entity relationships and attributes relevant to that process scope. The model should be refined based on actual organizational analysis and business requirements discovery.
