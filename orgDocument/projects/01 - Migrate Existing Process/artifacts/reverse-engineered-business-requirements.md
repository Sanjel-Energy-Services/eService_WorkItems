## Interview Transcript

**A:** Thank you for joining today. Can you walk me through the main business process for Sanjel's cementing services?

**BU:** Absolutely. Our process starts when a client from the oil & gas industry sends us a *Cementing Service Invitation*. This is the initial request for our expertise.

**A:** What happens after you receive the invitation?

**BU:** Once we get the invitation, we respond with a *Service Proposal & Bidding*. We outline our approach, costs, and timelines. The client reviews our proposal and then provides the *Bidding Result*—whether we've won or lost the bid.

**A:** If you win the bid, what are the next steps?

**BU:** The client sends us a *Cementing Service Request*. This is a formal go-ahead to start work. Internally, we move to *Perform Cementing Service*, which involves mobilizing our team, equipment, and materials to the well site.

**A:** How do you handle reporting and invoicing?

**BU:** After the job is done, we generate a *Service Report & Invoice* and send it to the client. The client then processes the payment.

**A:** Is there any post-job activity?

**BU:** Yes, we conduct a *Post Job Analysis* to review performance, lessons learned, and client feedback. This helps us improve future services.
