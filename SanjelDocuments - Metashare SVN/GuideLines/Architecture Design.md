== Background

The purpose of the User Administration Feature is to manage user roles, permissions, and other user-related functionalities within the app. This feature is critical for maintaining security, ensuring appropriate access levels, and facilitating user management operations.

== Requirements

The user administration feature must meet the following requirements:

*Must Have*:
- User registration and authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user profiles
- Password reset and recovery
- Audit logging for user actions

*Should Have*:
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- User activity tracking
- Notifications for important user actions (e.g., password change)

*Could Have*:
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration
- Customizable user permissions

*Won't Have*:
- Social media login integration (for initial release)

== Method

### Architecture Design

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
actor Admin

package "User Management" {
  User -> (Register)
  User -> (Login)
  User -> (Reset Password)

  Admin -> (Create User)
  Admin -> (Update User)
  Admin -> (Delete User)
  Admin -> (Assign Role)
}

package "Core Services" {
  (Authentication Service)
  (Authorization Service)
  (User Service)
  (Role Service)
}

User --> (Authentication Service)
Admin --> (Authentication Service)
(Authentication Service) --> (Authorization Service)
(Authentication Service) --> (User Service)
(Authentication Service) --> (Role Service)
