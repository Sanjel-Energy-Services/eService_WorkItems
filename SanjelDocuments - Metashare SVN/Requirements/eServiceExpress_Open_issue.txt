1. Timezone cross DST change issue - Printing

Solution: This has been solved by passing UTC time, Timezone, and flag to ignore DST to printing server.

Code change may apply to following spots:

In eServiceExpress solution:

PrintingController.CreateChartModelData()

in new ChartModel, assign start/end time to Axis Model, remove conversion to local time.

Version 82: Line 390 and Line 663

PrintingController.GetSeriesPoints()

Remove conversion of point.X value to local time.

Version 82: Line 736

In SanjelCommonLibrary solution:

AxisControl.GetLabelText()

                        else if (this.AxisModel.ChartIntervalType.Equals(ChartIntervalType.Seconds) || this.AxisModel.ChartIntervalType.Equals(ChartIntervalType.Minutes))
                        {
                            text = Convert.ToDateTime(text).ToString(labelFormat);
                        }

This is when the Axis label being rendered, mechanism to passing necessary timezone and DST fla is needed.


2. Print not together, Density and Temperature chart title is not correct.
Solution: each series should has it's own YAxisName
If it not print multiple series together, the chart title should use series YAxisName 


3. Projec configuration post_Build script could copy configurations, but publish cannot.
