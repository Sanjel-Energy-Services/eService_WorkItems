### General Rules for multiple Hauls

- Bulker Crew Log 
  - LoadRequested status can only be set automatically when next product haul assignment is available.
  - Returned status is mandatory to allow next haul being picked up
  - Down must be flagged when Crew is OffDuty. Any reason causes crew down will be handled in proper processes, these processes will be discovered later.
  - Setting  Crew status OffDuty will set all "Returned" assignment status as LogOffDuty
- Rig Board
  - Product Haul status change only affects LoadRequested, OnLocation, OffDuty status's of Bulker Crew Log under certain circumstances. Most of Bulker Crew status's will be skipped. The logic of status skipping won't be triggered to update Assignement status and product haul status.
